The transplant was a big deal, lots of doctors and beeping machines.  It was hard to be stuck in the hospital for so long.  But now I feel much better!  Sometimes, when I'm bored in the hospital, I practice moving my toys without touching them.  It's a good distraction.  It's much more exciting than being a computer student, that's
