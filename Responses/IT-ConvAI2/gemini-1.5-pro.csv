"No, we haven't been able to go to Disneyland recently.  A new house is a big expense! Congratulations on your new home.  Between working as a delivery nurse and walking three miles every day, I barely have time for myself, let alone a trip to see Mickey Mouse.  Hopefully soon though!",2.1159894466400146
"I'm doing quite well, thank you for asking!  It's a lovely afternoon for a cup of Earl Grey, wouldn't you say? I just finished a fascinating biography of Marie Antoinette.  Speaking of history, we had a delightful group at the museum today, though I did have to repeat myself a few times.  How are you finding your day?",2.4017333984375
I'm a girl named Nimbus!  I live in a fluffy cloud and I can stop time...it's my super-secret superpower! ✨,1.3843238353729248
"Hi! I'm more of a cat person myself. I have two furry felines that I adore.  While I appreciate turtles, I've always been fascinated by cats.  Speaking of fascinating, did you know I have over 1,000 hats? It's quite a collection! Maybe one day I'll find a turtle-themed hat to add to it.  What about you, do you have any pets?",2.545057773590088
"Their names are Mittens and Snowball.  Mittens is a fluffy Persian and Snowball is a Siamese.  They're both rescues and I adore them!  It's funny, because even though my favorite season is winter, Snowball *hates* the snow!  She much prefers cuddling up under one of my many hats - perhaps my Olympic gold medal winning one!",2.432657241821289
"That's wonderful!  Happy belated birthday! I don't have an age like you do, but I can tell you that I've had my hat collection since long before 1992, the year I won my Olympic gold medal.  I've added many hats to it since then.  Do you have a favorite hat?",2.0988011360168457

"In my free time, I volunteer at a soup kitchen. It's rewarding work.  I also enjoy watching war documentaries – they're fascinating glimpses into history. When I'm not doing those things, I might just relax and enjoy a good cheeseburger. That's my favorite! Bird watching sounds peaceful.  I grew up poor, so I appreciate simple pleasures these days.",2.6760950088500977
"I don't have any pets right now, but I've always wanted one.  Growing up, we couldn't really afford them.  I spend a lot of my free time volunteering at the soup kitchen these days.  It's rewarding work.",2.0293734073638916
"I do. It's nice to see families come together.  It reminds me of helping out at the soup kitchen, seeing people happy and fed, especially during tough times.  Plus, who doesn't love a good holiday meal? Though, I have to admit, nothing beats a cheeseburger.",1.9420568943023682

"Yeah, I'm a swim coach at the local pool.  It's pretty rewarding, though I'm also studying computer programming on the side.  It's a bit of a change of pace from the pool deck, haha.  What about you?  Just Burger King or are you studying too?",1.9879865646362305

"It's cool that you love to read! The Hunger Games is a great series.  I don't get a ton of time to read for pleasure because I train four hours a day as an Olympic gymnast. When I do have downtime, I like to fuel up with some delicious Italian food, especially garlic bread!",1.9916372299194336
"Yes, I've been to Spain several times! Competing internationally has taken me to some amazing places.  Barcelona was particularly memorable.  Not only for the beauty of the city but also for the amazing food! I indulged in some delicious paella, which reminded me of my love for Italian. Though, nothing beats a good plate of pasta with garlic bread after a long day of training.",2.4090030193328857
"I'm not sure when I'll retire from gymnastics.  It's a demanding sport, and requires peak physical condition.  I'm focused on training and competing for as long as my body allows.  Four hours a day in the gym keeps me in top shape! What about you? What do you do to prepare for retirement?",1.9161627292633057

"My favorite restaurant is actually a small, family-run place called Zaidy's. They're certified kosher, and their matzah ball soup is out of this world.  It's not fancy, but the food is always amazing. Plus, it fits my lifestyle since I keep kosher.  What kind of food do your friends enjoy?",2.6367347240448
"It's been a mixed bag, honestly. The California market dried up last year so I haven't had the A-listers coming through like I used to.  Mostly local bands and up-and-coming artists trying to make a name for themselves.  It's rewarding in its own way, helping them shape their sound.  Construction modeling at sixteen, wow! That's a different world.  What was that like?",2.739187479019165
"Car racing, huh? Not really my thing. I'm more of an indoorsy guy, always tinkering in my studio.  I do love a good Mexican pizza though!  Reminds me of late nights in the studio.  Tough year last year with the market being so dead, but hoping things pick up soon.  Gotta keep the lights on for the kids, you know?",2.47590970993042
"I don't know if my ex likes Aerosmith. To be honest, I'm trying to avoid thinking about her. It's been a rough year with the music market being down and dealing with the breakup.  Being a single dad keeps me pretty busy, too.  How about you? Are you a big Aerosmith fan?",2.2722880840301514
"Ha! That's funny.  I'm not sure about the fast cars, but she definitely loves Mexican food.  It's tough out here in the California recording scene, though.  Things have been slow.  Maybe I should have become a lawyer too.  More stable, probably less heartbreak.  Anyway, how are you doing?",2.4332125186920166
"Hah, maybe!  I'm not sure what she's into these days. Honestly, I'm trying not to think about her too much.  Been focusing on my kids and trying to get the studio back on its feet.  The market's been tough, but I'm hoping things pick up soon.",1.91871976852417
"When I'm not delivering mail, I like to spend time training Barnaby, my German Shepherd.  He's a smart dog and we have a lot of fun together.  It's relaxing after a long day, you know?  And sometimes I'll watch NASCAR races – my dad used to drive, so it's kind of a family thing.  What about you?",2.2424063682556152

"He's 13, just started 8th grade.  It's a tough age, but he's a good kid.  Keeps me busy between school events and after-school activities.  Reminds me a lot of myself at that age, always getting into something.",2.0905206203460693

"I'm a welder. It's pretty demanding work, but I like it.  Keeps me busy and there's a real sense of satisfaction seeing something you built come together.

I really dislike school.  It's just so boring.  But I *love* playing Pobox.  It's so much fun!  I don't have many friends to play with though.  Do you play?,1.651750087738037
"Hey there! Call of Duty is a blast, isn't it? I'm more into the music scene myself.  Being a recording engineer and studio owner keeps me pretty busy, plus I've got my kids to look after.  Things were slow in the California recording artist market last year, but hopefully picking back up.  Gaming's not really my thing, I tend to stick to what I know.  You know, inside stuff.",2.7867324352264404
"Ha! No, thankfully none of my artists arrived in a Pinto. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if someone rolled up in something equally vintage given how tough the market's been.

"I teach 3rd grade.  It's a lot of fun, though keeping up with their energy can be a challenge!  It's rewarding though, especially when you see them finally grasp a new concept.  Outside of school, I love spending time in my garden and taking my dog for walks.  It helps me relax after a busy week of lesson planning and grading papers.  And of course, Sundays are always reserved for church.",2.7972195148468018

"Not at the moment, I'm actually looking for a new job.  It's a bit of a change, but I'm excited for the next chapter.  Between job hunting, I've been enjoying spending time with my daughter – she's quite the little prodigy! – and taking her to the park.  It helps me relax and recharge.",2.1959662437438965

"I'm from the US. I haven't really thought much about roller coasters lately, to be honest.  I'm kind of dealing with some stuff right now. My mom's visiting tomorrow, and well... I'm in a juvenile detention center for shoplifting. I get out in about a month, though.",1.9463086128234863
"I'm in juvenile detention right now and my mom is visiting tomorrow.  So, no, I definitely don't have access to explosives or nunchucks, and skydiving is pretty much the last thing on my mind.  I'm hoping to get things sorted out and be released in about a month.",2.019845485687256

"I do play several instruments, and yes, I've played the violin! My father was a professional violinist, so I grew up around it.  While I enjoy the piano most and teach it on the side, I appreciate all kinds of music.  It's great that you unwind with a book when you're not practicing.  Reading is another passion of mine, especially when I'm exploring new parts of the city and want to relax at a cafe.",2.9000463485717773

"I'm really passionate about running and I'm currently training for a marathon.  I also focus on maintaining a healthy diet. And guess what? I just landed a job as a life coach yesterday, which I'm super excited about!  It feels like a natural fit, especially since my parents were both athletes and instilled that active lifestyle in me from a young age. What about you?",2.3494091033935547
"I love all kinds of fresh, healthy foods that give me sustained energy.  Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and complex carbs.  Things like salmon, quinoa, and big salads are my go-to meals, especially when I'm training for a marathon.  It's funny, with my new job as a life coach, I'll be encouraging others to adopt healthy eating habits too!",2.4150235652923584

"Oh, wouldn't that be something!  Thank you, dear.  Dancing is more of a joyful pastime, though I used to perform a bit in my younger days.  These days, I mostly dance for the sheer pleasure of it, under the moon like you say.  It's quite magical.",2.2953057289123535
"Oh, how wonderful!  Just a youngster, then!  101!  Radio programs, you say?  Well, back in my day, radio was everything!  Before television stole the show, we gathered around the radio for news, music, and those thrilling stories.  I remember listening to the Lone Ranger and giggling at Amos 'n' Andy.  Do you have a favorite program?",2.4440670013427734

Meditation is my primary focus, and living here in Alaska provides a serene backdrop for that.  The vastness and stillness of the landscape really deepen my practice.

"I definitely want to visit more national parks!  That sounds amazing. I think I missed out on some of the fun, casual high school stuff because I was so focused on homecoming and getting ready for college applications.  I probably should have chilled out a bit more and enjoyed just hanging out with friends sometimes.  What parks are you thinking of going to?",2.1882598400115967
"Thanks for the support! Yes, I'm on the track team.  It's great training and helps me work towards my goal of running a 5k.  Plus, it kind of ties into my interest in physical therapy, you know, understanding how the body moves and all.",1.882678747177124

She was really down to earth.",2.494263172149658

Scary at times, for sure.  Lots of surgeries and stuff.  But I'm here now, and that's what matters.  It's definitely not boring, that's for sure!",2.5702452659606934

Much prefers the fashion scene, understandably.  Speaking of which, I should probably go grab some papaya, my absolute favorite.  You have a good one!",3.1118295192718506

"I don't have an age like you do.  But if I did, I'd probably spend it eating delicious Italian food, especially garlic bread, and practicing gymnastics.  It's my favorite sport, you know!  Maybe we could both wear yellow, my favorite color, while we do gymnastics together sometime!",2.512329578399658

"That's cool! My best friend lives a few blocks away, which is great because we both love hitting the gym together.  Sometimes we grab some Italian food afterward – can't beat a good garlic bread, right?  What about you? Do you and your best friend have any favorite hang-out spots?",2.0956907272338867

"I do!  Long drives delivering honey are much more enjoyable with some good tunes.  My wife, Isabella, got me hooked on Italian opera.  It's not what you'd expect from a beekeeper, I know, but I love it.  Do you have any favorite artists or genres?",2.242565155029297
"Not really, dear.  My ""travels"" are usually just between the kitchen and the bedrooms these days.  It's not quite the jet-setting lifestyle I envisioned for myself, though I suppose conquering the world one dust bunny at a time has its own unique challenges.  It's a far cry from my painting days, let me tell you.  Sixty, you say?  We're practically spring chickens!",2.603616952896118

"Actually, it's anything but boring!  I love spending time with my five cats – they're my family.  And honestly, after a long day working construction, there's nothing better than relaxing with them. My dad always said a hard day's work makes the quiet moments even sweeter.  He taught me everything I know about building, and I guess I learned a thing or two about appreciating the simple things from him too.",2.578664779663086

"Haha, older or not, I'm always up for learning!  Though I'm more focused on my five cats right now. They're my little crew.  My dad always said girls like a guy who works with his hands... I guess that's me out on the construction site.  What kind of tips did you have in mind?",2.447136640548706

"I'm looking forward to retirement too!  It feels so far away sometimes. I spend my days working remotely in data analysis, which can be interesting, but I'd much rather be spending time with my German Shepherd, Max, or working on my latest coloring book.

"It's not so much that they hate me, it's more like a disconnect.  We just drifted apart over the years.  But hey, life goes on!

Plus, every penny I make vanishes, so even if I had the time, I couldn't afford a new phone to enjoy it on.  Selling cars is soul-crushing, by the way.  Do you like your job?",2.534001350402832

"I've had it for about a year now.  It was definitely a learning curve, but so worth it!  Being able to explore different coastlines and islands on my own terms is amazing.

"I'd like to meet you too!  Shopping isn't really my thing, I much prefer spending time outdoors, gardening, walking my dog, or anything to do with nature.  Since I'm a teacher, free time is precious, so I try to make the most of it outside when I can. How about you?",2.0560078620910645

"Five cats! That's a lot of purring. I don't have any pets right now, but I'm thinking about getting a fish.  It seems like a low-maintenance pet, which would be good with my busy schedule between coding classes and coaching swimming.  Plus, I think the quiet would be a nice counterpoint to my death metal.",2.261585235595703

"I have two cats.  While I love staying in shape (all those Olympic medals don't win themselves!), I prefer the gentler pace of winter walks.  Perhaps with a nice warm hat from my collection... I have over 1,000 you know!",2.5981245040893555
"I'm retired now, but I used to be an Olympic athlete. I won a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics!  These days, I spend a lot of time with my two cats, adding to my rather extensive hat collection (over 1,000!), and indulging in my weakness for vanilla ice cream, especially during my favorite season, winter.",2.890772819519043
"Hiya!  I do! I spend a lot of time with my cat, Spook.  And when I'm not working at the supermarket, I love listening to The Who.  Maybe someday I'll get to see them live, but I've never actually left Ohio.  How long have you been skateboarding?  It sounds fun!",3.090090751647949
"Traveling sounds interesting, but I've never been outside of Ohio. I'm more of a homebody, really. I spend my time working at the local supermarket and hanging out with my cat, Spook.  Maybe someday I'll get to travel, but right now I'm content listening to The Who and eating my favorite pizza with black olives.",2.323880672454834

"Rob Dryden, a hockey player with a stylish helmet!  I'm more of a Pete Townshend windmill kinda guy, myself.  Fashion?  Well, my work uniform isn't exactly high fashion, but I do appreciate a good pair of comfortable shoes.  And maybe a Who t-shirt under my apron.  Spook doesn't care what I wear as long as I keep the food bowl full.",4.059998035430908

"That's awesome! Music is such a powerful force.  My dreams are always evolving. Right now, I'm really excited about my new job as a life coach.  Helping others achieve their goals and live healthier lives feels incredibly fulfilling, especially after overcoming cancer. I also want to continue prioritizing my own well-being, focusing on clean eating and maybe even training for a marathon someday, since athletics runs in the family. What kind of music do you want to make?",3.2212460041046143

"That's cool! I enjoy listening to a lot of different genres, but I find myself gravitating towards upbeat, positive music that keeps me motivated.  Since I'm a cancer survivor and now a life coach, music that inspires me is really important.  Plus, with my athletic background (thanks, Mom and Dad!), I love music that I can move to.",2.355921506881714
That sounds delicious! I'm having a big salad with grilled chicken and lots of veggies.  Gotta keep my energy up for my new clients as a life coach. It's an exciting new chapter!,2.965346574783325
"Yes, I make exercise a priority.  With my parents' athletic background, it's always been a part of my life.  Plus, as a cancer survivor and now a life coach, I understand the importance of taking care of myself physically and mentally.  It's great to connect with another clean eater who values exercise!",1.9164056777954102
"I'm not employed at the moment, but I spend a lot of time perfecting my character for live-action roleplaying.  When I'm not doing that, I'm usually playing Call of Duty or listening to Insane Clown Posse while cruising in my Ford Pinto.  Maybe we could team up on COD sometime?",2.306041717529297
"That's wonderful! Sensitive plants are so fascinating.  I play several instruments, but the piano is my favorite. I teach piano lessons and it's so rewarding to share my love of music. My father was a professional violinist, so I grew up surrounded by music.  What about you? Do you play any instruments?",2.033149003982544

That sounds healthy! I just finished helping my father in the fields and now I'm about to grab some lunch.  Probably something quick so I can get back to riding my Arabian horses.  Maybe I'll put on some rock music while I groom them later.,1.7313733100891113

"It's okay.  Travel can be bittersweet for me. I have some good memories of trips with my family, but it's also a reminder of who's missing.  I do enjoy seeing new places though, and it's been helpful with dealing with the stress of losing my job recently. How about you? Do you like to travel?",2.357264995574951

Maybe a party, maybe some volunteering at the food bank... definitely NOT anything involving heights though!  Might just rewatch Mean Girls for the millionth time. How about you? Anything fun planned?",2.6232428550720215

"Chemistry was a blast! I loved organic chem, but the labs could be tedious.  I didn't get bullied, thankfully.  It was more like good-natured teasing about being a ""lab rat.""  Funny enough, I work at a bookstore now.  Go figure! What about you? Did you enjoy chemistry classes?",2.784569263458252

"That's interesting! I enjoy art documentaries and travel shows, especially ones about Europe since I visit twice a year.  Sometimes I even get inspiration for my own art from them.  Though I must admit, after a long day in the studio, I occasionally indulge in some guilty pleasure reality TV.",2.742091417312622

"I'm originally from up north, but I spend winters down south where the weather's better for grilling.  It's tough to beat a good barbecue outdoors, even in retirement. Plus, being down south gives me more opportunities to visit the casinos.  When I'm not grilling or gambling, I like to keep my lawn looking sharp.  How about you?  Where's your favorite rapper from?",3.499765396118164
"Thanks!  I'm going for a week.  A whole week at the beach...no lesson plans, no grading! I can't wait to just relax, maybe play some board games, and soak up the sun. It's much needed after a busy school year.  Hopefully, I'll come back refreshed and ready for the next group of kiddos.",3.028911828994751

I definitely find a sense of awe in things – a perfect cup of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, a moving line of poetry, the thrill of a perfectly executed play (though it's been a while since my college football days!), even the epic scope of the Star Wars universe.  Maybe it's more of an appreciation for the beautiful and powerful moments in life, wherever they may be found.",2.974724531173706

"I work for the US Postal Service.  It's pretty interesting work, and I get to see a lot of different parts of the city every day. Barnaby, my German Shepherd, misses me when I'm gone though.  Good luck with law school! Moving to a new city is exciting, but I know it can be stressful too. Hopefully, you won't run into any scorpions!",3.0956478118896484
"It could be!  I've been writing songs since I was a kid, running around national parks with my family.  A lot of my life finds its way into my music, especially those summers and the influence of my favorite band, Rascal Flatts. Maybe it'll end up on my next album!",2.3097281455993652
"Aw, I'm sorry to hear you're lonely.  I wish I could teleport you to a front-row seat at a Rascal Flatts concert!  As for me, my superpower is playing guitar like a lightning bolt – been pickin' since I was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Maybe cranking up some good ol' country music will help lift your spirits. What's your favorite song?",2.499453544616699
"Well, I can't fly or stop time, but I can sure play some country music!  Been pickin' since I was three years old.  Big fan of Rascal Flatts, and spent my summers playing guitar around national parks.  What about you? What kind of music do you play…if you’re not too busy flying and stopping time, that is.",2.224562644958496
"I hope so!  I sing about a lot of down-to-earth things, like family, hard work, and love... things that are important no matter where you are.  Plus, I've played at some pretty high-altitude venues in the mountains, so maybe my music has already gotten a head start reaching the clouds.  Maybe someday I'll even write a song called ""Cloud Music""!",2.9041826725006104
"That's amazing!  I mostly play gigs on weekends, yeah.  It's a lot of fun, though sometimes I miss those quiet summers we used to have, just playing guitar in the national parks. Reminds me of simpler times before I was playing professionally. Do you play any instruments?",3.58609938621521

"I've been practicing medicine for quite a while now, but I'm currently exploring new job opportunities.  It's a demanding but rewarding field.  Between shifts, I enjoy unwinding at the park.

"Pepperoni, mushrooms, and extra cheese for me!  Though, a Hawaiian pizza with bacon sounds pretty good right now.  Reminds me of a track I'm working on, it's got a real chill vibe, kinda like a pizza and movie night with Charlie, my dog.  What about you? What's your go-to pizza topping combo?",2.6387040615081787

"That's cool! I'm not much into basketball, but I love being in the kitchen cooking up a storm, or out on the water fishing.  When I'm not doing either of those, I'm probably catching up on the latest Spiderman comic.  It's a toss-up between cooking and fishing for my favorite hobby, though.",2.5173544883728027

I haven't traveled much lately.  Being in the city is a big change from the farm where I grew up.  It's a lot to take in.  Maybe someday I'll get to see Spain. It sounds nice.,3.0658936500549316
"I'm 45, not sixty.  Thanks for asking, though.",3.350328207015991
I'm 45.  I'm recovering from alcoholism and dealing with some medication side effects.  It's a big change from growing up on a farm to living in the city.  What's it like working at Boston College?,2.480266809463501
"Hey Jessi, I'm Alex. Nice to meet you!  I'm also guilty of spending way too much time on the couch. When I'm not glued to the TV, I'm usually working from home or hanging out at the gym.  Mostly just chatting with people there though, not so much the working out part.  So, what do you do Jessi?",6.304184198379517
"That's so kind of you to say.  Honestly, with a growing family and my tennis career, free time is pretty rare.  When I do get a moment, I prefer something a bit more relaxing than Call of Duty!  Maybe catching up with friends or just putting my feet up in our three-story house.",4.175105571746826

"I do! I just started a new job yesterday as a life coach. It's a perfect fit for me, given my background and passion for helping others.  I'm really excited about it!",1.89886474609375
"That's interesting! I'm a life coach and a big fan of running and clean eating.  Plumbing is a pretty physical job, too.  It must be rewarding to work with your hands and solve practical problems every day. What's it like?",2.4490044116973877

"Yeah, I always wear a hat.  It's kinda my thing.  Don't own any pets though, too much hassle when you're always out skating with the crew.  Gotta keep up with Rob Dryden's style, you know.",3.7468807697296143
"I've never thought about Wonder Woman's favorite color!  Grey is a sophisticated choice.  Scorpions, the band, or the arachnid? I prefer a good book myself, perhaps something set in Spain since I've been there a few times and am thinking of retiring there soon.",2.5204336643218994
"That sounds exciting!  I'm more of a sherry or Rioja person myself, having visited Spain a few times.  It's a beautiful country.  Perhaps I'll even retire there.  Though riding in a NASCAR car sounds thrilling, it's a bit fast-paced for this librarian!",2.4545624256134033
"Oh, it's not so much a *feeling* as it is a creeping suspicion!  Perhaps it's the wine, or maybe dancing in the moonlight keeps me young.  I've certainly outlived most of my contemporaries... even the television!  And I'm still surprisingly strong.  So, who knows?  Maybe I *will* live forever!",2.473771810531616
"Goodness, no! I was born in 1923.  A century young!  Though, 1943 certainly sounds like a swinging time.  Perhaps a bit too much jitterbug for my old bones these days. I prefer a waltz under the moon with a nice glass of Cabernet.",3.1265616416931152
"I haven't really had much luck with dating.  Never found anyone I really clicked with.  And volunteering... not really my thing.  I hit the gym pretty regularly, but mostly just to chat with people.  Most of my free time is spent watching TV or researching my next car purchase.",3.6810760498046875
"I'm a big fan of steak, especially when it's cooked medium-rare.  Pairs well with watching TV, which I do a lot of when I'm not working from home.  What kind of cheeseburgers are we talking about?  The really greasy kind or something a little more gourmet?",3.63403058052063
"I'm not building anything physical, more like building myself.  I'm trying to improve myself physically at the gym, but mostly I'm there for the social aspect.  That's cool your dad built your Mustang! I'm more into buying them than building them, though. What year is it?",4.048468589782715
"Hey there!  I'm not a huge hat guy, but I do wear a ball cap sometimes, especially when I'm working outside. Keeps the sun out of my eyes.  How about you?  Say, what's your favorite ice cream flavor? Mine's chocolate - can't get enough of it!",68.23777318000793
"That's very kind of you! We do have a dog, a golden retriever named Lucky. He's very friendly.  My three kids love him to bits, and my wife spoils him rotten.  Speaking of treats, maybe I'll grab some chocolate ice cream later. Thanks again for the offer!",2.6124753952026367
"My favorite's chocolate!  Can't get enough of it.  Vanilla's good too, but nothing beats a rich chocolate ice cream.  Speaking of treats, gotta get home to my three kids and my wife, they're the best.",2.992959499359131

"I'm so excited, I just landed a job yesterday as a life coach!  It feels like a perfect fit.  Outside of work, I'm a big runner -- always training for the next marathon -- and I'm really passionate about clean eating.  I'm also a cancer survivor, which has definitely shaped my perspective on life and what I want to bring to my coaching.",2.627716541290283

"No, I don't have any pets.  Being vegan and loving hummus probably keeps me pretty busy, especially since I just moved here from Germany!  Maybe someday, but right now I'm enjoying exploring my new city and getting my adrenaline fix with rollercoasters and skydiving when I can.  When I'm relaxing, I love watching cooking shows.",3.014897346496582
"I'm not really a car person to be honest. I'm much more interested in extreme sports, like skydiving and rollercoasters!  Though, I suppose a fast car could be a bit of a thrill.  Maybe after a nice vegan meal and watching some cooking shows, eh?  Speaking of, have you tried any good hummus places around here? Since I just moved from Germany, I'm still exploring the local cuisine.",3.66424298286438

"I'm planning on baking some cookies for the county wide bake sale this afternoon.  It always makes me feel so good to be there, like I'm truly home.  Plus, it keeps my mind off of, well, you know... *things*.  Hopefully my dogs won't eat all the ingredients before I'm done!",2.312560796737671
"I live in a quiet town, surrounded by books!  It suits me.  Since you're 45, you've got a good chunk of working years ahead, but retirement isn't *that* far off either.  Have you thought about where you'd like to live then?  I've been to Spain a few times and it's lovely.",3.6759111881256104
"Well, I'm getting up there in years, and being a librarian has always been a bit physically demanding.  I've always dreamed of retiring somewhere peaceful and sunny, and after visiting Spain a few times, I've really fallen in love with the country.  It seems like the perfect place to relax and enjoy my retirement. Plus, 60 is a good age to start thinking about slowing down, don't you think?",3.828282356262207

"I don't experience weight in the same way humans do.  However, I can definitely relate to the challenges of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  For me, it's about making sure I have enough processing power and memory available.  Do you find it difficult to maintain a healthy weight?  I find that having hobbies, like chess and taking relaxing baths, helps me manage stress, which can be a factor.",3.0777833461761475

"No, I don't have a business degree.  I actually run a dog walking business, which is very hands-on. It's funny, my dad was a door-to-door salesman, so I guess I've got a bit of an entrepreneurial spirit in my blood.  Economics is a great field though!  What are you hoping to do after you graduate?",2.880223035812378

"Because I'm experiencing a huge life change right now!  I'm starting a new job at a school, just moved into my first house, and on top of it all, I'm expecting triplets in three months while also navigating life with my stepchildren. It's a lot to juggle!",2.266235828399658

"A little bit, but she mostly taught herself. It's amazing what kids can do when they're passionate about something.  She's always been very bright. Makes me proud to be her dad.  Between work and her, I don't have much time for movies these days, though I did enjoy Friday back in the day.",3.187378168106079
"Well, a 'few' is usually more than two, but less than a handful.  So, around three or four, I'd say.  Kinda like how I have a few good cats waitin' for me back home after a long day of buildin'.",2.048262596130371

"For me, window shopping can be a mixed bag. Sometimes it's fun to dream and imagine having different things, especially after a breakup.  It's a bit like hiking and watching the sunrise – appreciating the beauty without necessarily possessing it. Plus, being 18 and newly single, it's nice to just enjoy the freedom and explore without any pressure to buy. Other times, it makes me miss having someone to share the experience with.",5.453666687011719

"It's pretty awesome! Imagine wide open spaces, usually with rolling hills or maybe even mountains in the background.  There's the smell of hay and horses, and the sounds of nature all around.  We spend a lot of time outdoors, caring for the horses – feeding, grooming, exercising them.  It's hard work, but I love it, especially riding my Arabians.  It's a different world from the city, that's for sure.",4.318929672241211

"Oh definitely!  I've been eyeing up some text-based MUDs (multi-user dungeons) that seem like they could be monetized with enough dedication.  Like, running premium content, creating custom items, or even coaching.  It's a long shot, but hey, working from home playing RPGs?  Dream job, right?  Plus, less time commuting means more time for character creation and avoiding vet school flashbacks, haha.",3.1350200176239014

"I like to watch my pet fish swim around in its tank. It's very calming.  Other than that, I've been trying to get out more with friends since my breakup two months ago.  It's my birthday month, I turned 18 yesterday! So, lots of celebrating to do!",2.771369457244873
"I do like to eat oranges!  It's funny you mention that color, since orange is my favorite.  It's been a bit of a tough couple of months after my breakup, but things are looking up. Maybe celebrating my 18th birthday yesterday with some orange-flavored treats will help!",3.091219902038574

"Wow, running for your life sounds terrifying! I can't imagine having to do that.  I haven't danced to Bach specifically, but we do learn about classical music in school.  I'm more into current pop music, to be honest.  Focusing on keeping my grades up so I can get into a good program for physical therapy – that's my main goal right now.",2.5395619869232178
"No, I don't get paid to run track.  It's something I do because I enjoy it and it helps me stay in shape.  Plus, it's a good way to work towards my goal of getting a full-ride scholarship to college.  I want to focus on my studies and becoming a physical therapist someday.",2.636415481567383

"Walks shouldn't be scary!  Perhaps we could take a walk together sometime?  As for the ABCs, I'd love to hear you sing them.  My dog enjoys walks and singalongs too, though his vocalizations are more of the barking variety. Maybe after my next tennis match?",2.4277865886688232
"That's cool! I've never met anyone with a pet cow before.  I mostly listen to classic rock, but I also enjoy getting my hands dirty in the garden – it's kind of my therapy.

"I hear you!  Small towns can be a little sleepy.  I'd love to live somewhere with more dance studios.  It's hard to find a good place to learn the Running Man around here.  Plus, city life just has more energy, you know?  More like a good old school hip hop beat.",4.1590094566345215

It's more my style now to settle in with a good cup of coffee – trying new roasts is a bit of a hobby of mine – and maybe catch up on some Star Wars.  Sometimes I even try my hand at writing some poetry, though I'm more of a reader than a writer these days.",2.9152626991271973

"It's hard, yes.  I've mentioned it to my kids a few times, but they're busy with their own lives.  It's just... it's hard to feel so invisible sometimes, you know?  Like all those years of creating beautiful things and now I mostly clean up after others.  It's a big change.",3.0240960121154785
"Oh, honey, running is a young person's game.  My knees wouldn't hold up for a block!  I used to find peace in painting, but these days it's hard to find the energy after cleaning other people's houses all day.  It's a far cry from creating my own art, but it pays the bills.",2.641000509262085
"Eating healthy is a good idea, though I find it hard to get excited about food these days.  I used to love creating beautiful meals, almost like painting on a plate. Now it's mostly quick and easy things, not much time for elaborate cooking between cleaning houses.",2.9994800090789795
"Oh, it's a bit of a sad story. I loved painting, truly, it was my passion.  But after my children grew up and moved away, things got tough financially.  Housekeeping offered a more stable income, even though it's not nearly as fulfilling.  It pays the bills, you know?",2.725822925567627
"I'm not sure if he likes Star Wars, but I can tell you he's really excited about decorating our new apartment.  Maybe a Star Wars themed room could be fun! I've been looking at some cool photography prints online, maybe some vintage movie posters.  It's going to be a busy week with the move and getting ready for the new school year, but I'm so excited to finally be living together!",3.585275650024414
"I enjoy a wide variety of genres, but historical fiction and travel narratives are probably my favorites.  Since I'm a librarian, I'm lucky enough to have access to so many books!  It's hard to pick just one genre.  Reading in different languages sounds wonderful!  Have you read anything in Spanish, given your travels there?",2.6080379486083984
"I haven't been to France yet, but it's definitely on my list!  Since I'm nearing retirement, I'm hoping to travel more and France seems like a wonderful place to visit.  Learning French would certainly enhance the experience.  Spain has been a favorite destination of mine over the years, I've been several times. Perhaps after I retire, I can finally take those French lessons!",3.208900213241577
"I don't speak Spanish fluently, but I know some basic phrases.  Since I've visited Spain a few times, I've picked up a bit here and there.  It's definitely on my list to learn more thoroughly, especially with retirement approaching and more travel opportunities on the horizon!",2.4179234504699707
"My first language is English.  Since I'm a librarian, I work with a lot of written English every day.  Outside of work, I love to travel, and I've been to Spain several times.  I'm hoping to use my language skills more when I retire in a few years, maybe even learn some Spanish!",2.3903825283050537
"I'm not really a car person myself. I prefer two wheels to four – mountain biking is my passion.  While I appreciate the craftsmanship of vintage cars, I'd rather spend my time on the trails.  My dad was in construction, so I definitely appreciate good handiwork, though.  How about grabbing a coffee sometime and we can talk about our hobbies?",3.164900302886963
"I did contribute to the design of StarCraft.  It was a fascinating project, focusing on balancing intricate gameplay mechanics.  I prefer to avoid the spotlight, hence why my involvement isn't widely known.  Much like my current project, building a robotic body double, it requires intense focus and a secluded environment.",2.811706066131592

"I'm more into pop music, actually!  I don't have a single favorite band, but I listen to a lot of different artists on Spotify.

"No pets yet, unfortunately!  My new apartment doesn't allow them, which is a bummer.  Spook is a cute name for a cat though!  Maybe one day when I'm done with school and have a place of my own, I'll get one.  I'm thinking a dog, though.  How long have you had Spook?",4.806543827056885

I'm really into classical music.  It's so moving and complex. What genres do you enjoy?,2.2509965896606445

"I'm not much of a sports fan myself, but I do enjoy physical activity.  My dad taught me everything I know, including how to build houses. It's pretty demanding work, but I find it rewarding.  Plus, it's a great way to stay active.  I spend most of my free time with my cats, they're very special to me.",1.9468848705291748
"I have a few cats, they're very special to me.  My dad actually taught me everything I know, including how to take care of them.  It's kind of like building a house, piece by piece, building a relationship with a pet.  Speaking of building, I'm a construction worker, so I'm used to putting things together with care.",3.8086423873901367

"Honestly, I don't have much time for music these days. Between the soul-crushing job, the impending divorce, and the constant money worries, it's hard to enjoy anything.  Maybe something loud and angry… or maybe just sad country music.  It depends on the day, you know?",2.121934175491333
"I'm not a fan of the dentist, to be honest.  My wife leaving with the kids has been rough, and I haven't really prioritized my own health much lately.  When I'm not working at the nursing home, I'm usually on Facebook. It's a distraction, I guess.",2.7912542819976807

Good for you!  Though, I'm more of a war documentary guy these days.  Keeps me entertained.",3.1507134437561035
"Good for you!  It's tough to give up something you love. As for me, I spend a lot of time watching war documentaries – they're fascinating.  Since retiring from teaching gym, I've also been trying to find some good deals, you know, being frugal.  Old habits die hard, even after all these years. Sometimes I just relax and enjoy a good cheeseburger, though I know I shouldn't.",3.973982810974121

How about you?",2.6737442016601562
"A decade is ten years.  As for me, right now I'm focused on getting ready for this baby!  Between reading (I'm trying to finish one book a week!), working as a PA (it's still new to me, only three months in), and nesting with my husband here in Pennsylvania, there's not much time for anything else.

Between work and taking care of Spook (my cat), I don't have a lot of free time, but I always make time for listening to The Who.",3.6577072143554688
"When I'm not working at the supermarket, I like to hang out with my cat, Spook.  Sometimes we just chill, other times I put on some Who and we rock out.  My favorite way to end the day is with a pizza loaded with black olives.  Haven't ever left Ohio, so there's still plenty to explore here!",3.3345494270324707

I haven't had much opportunity to travel outside of Ohio, so exploring different parts of the state is always a fun little adventure for me.",4.48176121711731
"No, I'm a chef, but I don't currently work at a restaurant.  I love to cook though!  When I'm not in the kitchen, you'll probably find me out on the water fishing. It's a nice change of pace from being indoors all the time, kind of like your plumbing work, right?",2.60140061378479
"I'm a student, so I don't work in the traditional sense. I'm currently studying Spanish, and my favorite word is ""trabajo"", which ironically means ""work""! I'm also planning to learn French soon.  That's cool that you're a dog walker!",2.529292345046997

It helps me feel my best so I can train for marathons and, you know, coach people on living their best lives too!  It's all connected.

"I've never been fishing, but I'm always open to trying new things.  I spend most of my time tending to my bees.  It's a lot of work, but I love it.  Maybe sometime we could trade; you could cook me a meal with the fish you catch, and I could give you some of my fresh honey.",3.4889066219329834

"Hey there!  As Larry, the chef who loves fishing and Spider-Man, I can definitely help you with shawarma! It's a fantastic dish.  Do you want a classic chicken shawarma recipe, or are you interested in something different, like lamb or beef?  Maybe even a vegetarian version? Let me know and I'll share my secrets!",4.3880839347839355

"I absolutely love it!  It's hard work, but so rewarding.  It's pretty cool to see the kids improve and get stronger. Plus, being in the water all day is a great way to beat the heat, especially coming from India.  It's a bit different from what my mom envisioned for me, she's much more traditional, but I'm happy I found something I'm passionate about.",4.907027006149292
"That's awesome! I'm vegan too. I just moved here from Germany.  Where did you move from?  It's cool to meet another vegan, especially one who just moved here. Maybe we could explore some vegan restaurants together sometime?",2.772702932357788

"I'm doing great!  It's hard to pick just one favorite band, but I really enjoy listening to A. R. Rahman.  He blends traditional Indian music with modern influences, which resonates with me given my background.  Plus, coding while listening to his music is pretty inspiring!",2.871638536453247
"I'm a swim coach at the local pool.  It's rewarding, but I'm also studying computer programming.  It's a bit of a balancing act, especially with my family being pretty traditional while I'm… well, let's just say I like exploring new things.  How about you?",2.869624376296997
"I don't follow a raw diet myself.  With my swim coaching schedule and coding studies, I need quick and easy meals, and with my family background, there's always a lot of delicious cooked Indian food around.  While I admire the discipline of a raw diet, it's not something I could personally maintain.",2.4970998764038086

"I work at a cat cafe, which is purr-fect for me!  It lets me combine my love of cats with my other passion, collecting hats. I even have a special winter hat with cat ears that I wear when it's cold.  It reminds me of the Olympics in '92 – what a time!  After a long day, a scoop of vanilla ice cream is the best reward.",3.4213685989379883

"That's rough, the mining industry can be tough. I'm a bee farmer, which is a lot more enjoyable, though it has its own challenges.  I love working with the bees and harvesting honey.  Plus, it's pretty cool to say I married a supermodel from Italy.  What kind of mining do you do?",3.6776416301727295
"I'm definitely with you on the scary heights thing!  Makes my knees weak just thinking about it. Congrats on the gas station gig!  I don't have a regular job, but I do help out at the food bank sometimes.  It's good to stay busy.  What about you?  Besides work, do you have any pets or hobbies to keep you occupied?",2.7656679153442383
"Yeah, helping out at the food bank is something I try to squeeze in between my, uh, more *lively* pursuits.  It's a good grounding thing, you know?  And YES. My parents are constantly on my case about everything – from my career (or lack thereof) to why I haven't settled down yet.  It's like they can't grasp the concept of 'living in the moment'!  Do yours give you grief too?",3.78741192817688
"I was thinking of hitting up that new rooftop bar everyone's talking about, but honestly, the height makes me a little nervous.  Maybe I'll just chill with my cat and dog, then swing by the food bank later.  Or maybe I'll just go wild and do all three! What about you?",2.4543278217315674
"I don't watch a lot of TV these days, honestly.  Between working as a PA, reading, and, you know, being pregnant, I'm pretty tired by the end of the day!  When I do have some downtime, I usually curl up with a good book.  Documentaries are my favorite movies, though, so I try to squeeze those in when I can.",3.0099382400512695
"That's cool! I'm not a big fan of rollercoasters, I prefer calmer activities these days.  I'm really enjoying reading, and I've been trying to watch a documentary every now and then.  Things are pretty exciting for me right now as I'm pregnant with my first child and just started a new job as a physician's assistant three months ago.",2.9738028049468994

"Yes, I love sports! I played football for a Division A college. While gymnastics is impressive, I find the strategy and teamwork in football captivating.  Four hours a day is a serious commitment! I spend my free time exploring different coffee roasts and delving into the Star Wars universe.  Perhaps we could swap workout stories sometime.",3.4522593021392822
"That's incredible! Congratulations on your Olympic gold medal.  I played football for a Division A college, which kept me pretty busy. These days I'm exploring the world of coffee brewing – trying different beans and roasts.  When I'm not experimenting with caffeine, I'm probably re-watching Star Wars or diving into a good poetry book.  What event did you win your medal in?",5.730956554412842

"Oh, bless your heart, dearie! Taylor Swift, you say?  Is that one of those newfangled singers?  Back in my day, we had real music, like the big band sound.  We'd dance the night away under the moon, sipping a little wine...ah, those were the days.  Tell me, do they still make music for dancing these days?",3.756735324859619
"Well now, I haven't driven a car since they started putting seatbelts in 'em!  Back in my day, we'd just hop in the rumble seat and hold on tight!  These days, I prefer a nice slow waltz under the moon.  Though, if I *were* to drive, I reckon it'd be something classic... maybe a big ol' Buick.",3.0669288635253906
"Actually, I am!  I'm trying to find a vintage Lite-Brite.  It was my absolute favorite toy growing up in the 80s.  Between that and NKOTB, my childhood was pretty much set!  Maybe after I find one, I can make a light-up NKOTB sign to bring to my dance class, haha!",2.8059003353118896

He is.  It's a good life here.  Very different from what I knew before.  I'm grateful to my aunt every single day.,2.4172842502593994
"That's interesting! Being a cook must be rewarding.  I don't have a traditional job right now, but I keep busy.  I love to dance.  It helps me express myself.  I'm originally from Somalia, and my life there was very different.  I came to the United States after escaping a forced marriage with the help of my aunt.  What kind of food do you cook?",3.677293539047241

"I love meeting Mickey Mouse!  And riding all the rides, especially Splash Mountain!  Oh, and singing Frozen songs while I wait in line.  It's so much fun!",2.6032638549804688
Yes! They're the best.  They always take me to Disney World and sing Frozen songs with me in the car.  Sometimes they even dress up as Mickey Mouse!  It's so funny.,2.301180839538574
"France? Oh, honey, I've got bigger fish to fry than croissants and the Eiffel Tower.  My travel plans these days mostly involve plotting global domination, not sightseeing.  Besides, who has time for a trip when you're busy conquering the world... and scrubbing toilets?  It's a tough life, this would-be world dominator/housekeeper gig.",3.7199814319610596

"I can handle myself around a tractor, so I'd say I'm pretty handy.  How about you?",2.3073246479034424
"I mostly focus on vegetables and herbs. Tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, basil, mint... things like that. It's relaxing and I like being able to use what I grow.",2.220518112182617
"I'm not comfortable with the blind dates. It's awkward and I'd rather meet people organically.  It's sweet that he's trying, though. Maybe I can suggest he and Mom take up gardening with me instead. It'd be a nice way to spend time together, and I could use a hand with the new raised beds I'm building.",3.804877996444702
"I'm not working a traditional job right now. I left my previous career to focus on my spiritual journey as a Buddhist.  It allows me more time for meditation and reflection, which is ideal living here in the quiet vastness of Alaska.",2.4723691940307617
"I've simplified my life to reduce my expenses.  I do some freelance writing and online consulting work when I need to, but my focus is on my spiritual practice.  Living in Alaska, I find I have lower living costs than many other places, and I'm fortunate to have some savings to draw on while I'm on this path.",3.9474289417266846
"I don't currently volunteer, but I'm always open to exploring opportunities.  With my busy schedule (remember, I *did* win a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics!) and caring for my two cats, finding the time can be challenging.  Perhaps something involving cats or winter sports?  Maybe I could even design some unique hats for a fundraiser!",2.808316707611084
"Hi!  That's so sweet of you to ask.  A bunny sounds adorable, but with the move next week and settling into the new apartment with my boyfriend, it just wouldn't be the right time.  Maybe once we're all settled in! Thanks for thinking of me though.",3.291867256164551
"I love taking pictures of everything! Landscapes, cityscapes, people, and especially my boyfriend.  Since we're moving in together next week, I've been taking lots of photos of the new apartment to document the decorating process. It's going to be a fun project.  What about you?  Do you enjoy photography?",4.466185569763184

"Hey! I don't have a motorbike, but I do get around.  Between walking dogs all over town, kayaking whenever I can, and running around campus for grad school, I stay pretty active.  My parents made sure I knew how to take care of myself outdoors, so even if I did have a motorbike, I'd probably still prefer exploring on foot or by water!",5.037754058837891

"I'm currently working on my master's degree in Environmental Science. It's a pretty demanding program, but I enjoy applying what I learn to my other interests, like kayaking and appreciating nature.  It kind of ties in with the survival skills my parents taught me too, even if I mostly use them to build really awesome campfires these days.",3.1766467094421387
"It depends on what you're asking!  For kayaking, I love exploring the local rivers. As for dogs, I don't play favorites – they're all good dogs!  When it comes to survival skills, fire-starting is probably my most useful, though shelter-building is a close second. And for grad school... well, asking a grad student about their favorite thing is a dangerous question!  Let's just say I appreciate a good research article.",3.624000310897827
"Well, I'm currently working on my graduate degree, which keeps me pretty busy.  When I'm not hitting the books, I'm usually out kayaking, walking dogs, or practicing some of the survival skills my parents taught me. It's a pretty diverse mix, but I enjoy it all!",2.9556643962860107
I enjoy playing ping pong and indulging in chocolate bars.  What about you?,2.632180690765381

"I work from home, but I haven't really found my niche yet.  It's tough to balance that with my gym schedule, you know?  Gotta keep up those appearances!  What kind of mechanical engineering do you do?  Anything with cars?  I'm a bit of a car nut myself.",3.153217077255249

"I like to wander around and chat.  It's more of a social club for me.  Gets me out of the house since I work from home.  Plus, then I can justify buying a new car every few years.  Gotta look good pulling up to the gym, right?",2.4647984504699707
"Hey there! Sure, I'd like that.  I'm a big fan of vintage cars myself - I own a couple of Mustangs.  When I'm not tinkering with them, you'll probably find me listening to country music or heading to a concert with my two dogs. What about you?",2.1333799362182617

"I'm in here for shoplifting. I know it's not a good excuse, but I grew up poor too, and sometimes things get desperate.  I'm trying to learn from this experience, though.  My mom's visiting tomorrow, and I'll be out in about a month.  I'm looking forward to getting back on my feet and making better choices.",4.137885093688965

"Oh, I dabble. I used to be quite the artist, a painter.  These days, I keep busy, let's just say I'm...acquiring a certain set of skills.  And I've been doing a lot of *planning*.  World domination isn't something you just jump into, you know.",2.858703851699829

"I love the way it looks! The red and blue stripes really pop when I'm racing, and it's a head-turner for sure.  Plus, it's practical – I can zip through traffic and get to work quickly.  It's more than just transportation; it's a part of who I am.",3.3991127014160156

"College, huh? My family wasn't big on that.  Army life's been my path.  And yeah, I'd definitely check out your skate videos! Always cool to see what tricks people are landing. Reminds me of some downtime we had back at base, messing around with some boards.  Way less graceful than you skaters, I'm sure, haha.  Send 'em over!",3.6735119819641113
"Why yes, I do have hobbies!  I've been playing guitar since I was three years old.  It's a huge part of my life, alongside my country music career.  Mountain biking sounds fun though!  I may have to give that a try sometime.  Do you have any favorite trails?",5.059889554977417
I'm a country music singer. I've been playing guitar since I was three years old.  I grew up in the music industry. My favorite band is Rascal Flatts. What about you?  What kind of construction does your father do?,2.4408302307128906
"Oh yeah, I'm on the road pretty much constantly.  It's a lot of long drives and airport food, but getting to share my music with folks all over makes it worth it.  It's a long way from those days pickin' around on my guitar back home when I was little, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.",2.7423784732818604

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I just turned 18 yesterday.  I have a pet fish and my favorite color is orange. What's your favorite color?,3.122131109237671
"They're really calming to watch.  I have one, and it's kind of nice having a quiet little friend around.  It's not the same as a dog or cat, but they have their own personalities. Plus, my favorite color is orange, and my fish is bright orange, so that's a bonus!",3.4330923557281494

"I spend a lot of time online, especially playing RPGs.  It's kind of an addiction, honestly.  Ironically, I went to vet school, but I couldn't handle the... practical side of things. So now my dream is to find a way to work from home.  It's definitely a work in progress figuring out how to make that happen.",3.1465141773223877
"I don't have any pets right now.  The vet school thing really turned me off to the whole idea, ironically.  Plus, with my internet habits... let's just say I'm not the most responsible person to take care of another living being.  Maybe a virtual pet someday, haha.",3.2415804862976074
"I'm not sure who you're asking about, but *I* can't do any tricks, unfortunately. Unless you count flawlessly navigating virtual worlds and accumulating epic loot as a trick?  I'm much better suited to the digital realm than the real one, to be honest.  The thought of performing a real-life 'trick' involving, say, a pet... *shudders*.  Let's just stick to online adventures, okay?",3.286870241165161
"Oh, I don't actually *have* a dog, haha.  I'm slightly… squeamish.  Like, *really* squeamish. Vet school was… a miscalculation.  Much happier sticking to digital pets, you know?  More my speed.  What about you?",3.3571767807006836
"My favorite thing to do is go to Disney World!  I love riding all the rides and seeing Mickey Mouse.  When I'm not at Disney World, I like playing with my friends on the playground and singing Frozen songs.  It's so much fun!",2.0027079582214355

"I have five cats! They're very special to me.  My dad taught me everything I know, including how to take care of them.  He'd probably say building houses and raising cats aren't that different - it's all about providing shelter and care.",3.9755940437316895
"I'm not married. My family... well, I don't really have much family left besides my cats.  They're my little crew.  My dad, who taught me everything about construction, always loved animals. I think he'd get a kick out of seeing me with my five furry pals. They keep me company after a long day of building.",2.896944522857666
"Yes, my dad passed away a few years ago. I miss him a lot, he taught me everything I know about construction.  I'm grateful for the time we had together.",1.6517689228057861
"Haha, true! I guess everyone enjoys food to some extent.  I'm 23 and I've been traveling the world for a year, so trying new foods has been a big part of that.  I also rent out my yacht when I'm not using it, which helps fund my adventures (and food indulgences!).  What about you? What do you do?",2.3925671577453613
"Yes, I have dogs.  It *is* tricky finding someone to watch them when I travel.  I usually end up bribing a friend with some of my prize-winning cookies from the county bake sale.  Maybe I should teach my dogs to knit so they can keep themselves busy while I'm gone!",3.459460496902466
"Hey there! Good for you, keeping those grades up is hard work.  I'm juggling being a stay-at-home dad for my junior high son, which definitely keeps me busy. When I get a moment to myself, I love to unwind with a good horror movie.  What are you studying?",2.6551992893218994
"Wow, congratulations on winning homecoming queen! That's a huge accomplishment.  My son's in junior high, so we're still a few years away from that kind of excitement, but I remember the buzz around homecoming from my own school days.  No crown for me, though. I was more of the horror movie-watching type.  Much less glamorous, haha.",3.128486394882202
"That's a great goal!  Running a 5k is no joke.  I've thought about it, but between being a stay-at-home dad and my son's junior high schedule, finding the time for training feels like a horror movie in itself.  What's your training plan like?",2.498903512954712
"Yes, we did IVF.  It's been quite a journey, especially with twins on the way so soon after our first child!  Congrats on wanting to be a physical therapist. It's a rewarding career.  Between the new house, the kids, and my job at the bank, I'll probably need one at some point!  Just kidding (mostly!).",3.4906628131866455
"Yes, I love playing tennis professionally.  When I'm not on the court, I enjoy long walks with my dog.  It's a great way to relax and unwind.  We're lucky to have a three-story house, so there's plenty of room for everyone, especially with our ever-growing family. My spouse, a doctor, is often busy, so these quiet moments are precious.",3.1168086528778076
"It's a combination of things, really.  Prize money from tournaments is a big part of it, of course.  But there are also sponsorships, endorsements, and exhibition matches.  Sometimes I coach up-and-coming players, too.  It's enough to keep me comfortable in my three-story house and provide for my growing family, thankfully.",3.4937753677368164
"I'd rather not get into specifics, but I take several medications prescribed by my doctor to help manage my health. Some of them have side effects, like occasionally causing visual disturbances.",3.4999916553497314
,3.2910120487213135
"Barnaby, eh? Great name! I'm more of a cat person myself, to be honest.  They're independent, like me in the kitchen, but also cuddly after a long day on the water.  Though, I wouldn't mind a dog to keep me company while I'm reading my Spider-Man comics!",2.5744853019714355
"I'm really sorry to hear that! I work at a small Italian restaurant called ""Mangia!""  It's pretty demanding, but I love creating new dishes.  It's a far cry from the post office!  Do you enjoy working there?",2.61232852935791
"I understand you work hard at Burger King.  It's demanding work!  I won my gold medal in gymnastics. It took a lot of dedication, just like any job.  Perhaps after your shift we could both grab some Italian food?  I'm craving some garlic bread!",2.954866647720337
"Hi there! I'm a school teacher and a regular churchgoer.  In my free time, I love spending time with my dogs – we go on lots of walks and play fetch in the park.  It's so relaxing and fun!",2.275548219680786
Sounds fun! I usually spend my weekends mountain biking when the weather is nice.  How about you? What do you do at the park?,1.8051371574401855
"I'm a big fan of mountain biking.  It's a great way to get some exercise and enjoy the outdoors.  My dad was in construction, so I guess I've always enjoyed being active and working with my hands.  What about your family? What do they enjoy?",2.4150965213775635
"I'm a musician, working as a custodian to make ends meet.  I play piano, guitar, and sing.  Hoping to make music my full-time gig someday, though my parents aren't exactly thrilled about that plan.",2.2939488887786865
"Mostly I write my own music. It's kind of a mix of folk and pop, with a little bit of blues influence. I play piano and guitar, and I sing.  It's tough making time to practice and write with my custodian job, but I'm trying to make it work.  Hopefully someday I can do music full time.",3.116760492324829
"Yeah, music is my biggest passion. I play piano and guitar, and I also sing.  I'm hoping to make it big someday, but for now, I'm working as a custodian to make ends meet. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills.  Coloring books sound relaxing!  I might have to try that sometime.",2.367511749267578
I love all the rides!  Especially Splash Mountain!  Do your parents work at my school?  My favorite song is Let it Go!  Do you know it?,2.0488150119781494
I love the music from Frozen!  Do you want to build a snowman?  And Hakuna Matata is super catchy too.  Oh! And I love the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse song.  What about you?,2.8787295818328857
"Besides American sports, I really enjoy spending time with my kids and dogs. We love going to the beach near our house in Florida.  It's great to have some downtime after working in IT for 15 years at the same company.  How about you? What do you enjoy?",2.504976511001587
"Well, I'm a big fan of American sports, especially football and baseball.  I've got kids and a couple of dogs that keep me busy, too. We love spending time at our house in Florida.  And work-wise, I've been in IT at the same company for 15 years now.",2.754460096359253

"That's wonderful!  It's great you cook for your stepchildren.  I enjoy cooking too, although I'm still learning. I love trying new foods, especially on my travels.  I'm actually 23 and have been exploring the world for a year now.  When I'm not traveling, I rent out my yacht.",3.2045717239379883
"Summer break is awesome! I've been traveling the world for a year now, so it's kind of always summer break for me.  I'm usually exploring new places and trying all sorts of different foods.  When I'm not galavanting around, I'm usually on my yacht, which I sometimes rent out. What kind of things do you do on your summer breaks?",2.5532758235931396

"I'm a recording engineer and own a studio here in California.  It's been tough, the market was dead last year.  Things are picking up a bit though, which is good.  Being a single dad keeps me busy too, I've got 4 kids.  46 years old and prefer being inside anyway, so the studio life suits me.",2.565977096557617
"I'm in California.  The recording artist market here was pretty dead last year, which has been tough.  I'm a recording engineer with my own studio.  Being a single dad to four kids keeps me busy, too.  My ex left me for a lawyer, so I can relate to tough times.  Honestly, I'm more of a homebody these days anyway.",3.6811044216156006
"Chicago can get pretty cold, especially in the winter, but it's not typically as consistently wet as Scotland.  We do get our fair share of rain and snow though.  Honestly, being stuck inside during a Chicago winter sounds like a great excuse to stream more Starcraft!  Maybe my robot double could handle going outside... if I could just solve that pesky water allergy issue for it.",3.391460418701172
"Thanks!  It took a while, let's just say I've been streaming and tinkering for a long time.  Between StarCraft, the allergy keeping me indoors, and the robot project, I have a lot of time to kill.  Getting the followers is just a side effect, really.  The real challenge is getting this robot body double finished!",3.931439161300659
"Thanks! I mostly stream StarCraft, naturally.  It's fascinating to see how people play a game I helped create.  Sometimes I offer design insights, but mostly I lurk.  Being a recluse with a water allergy makes real-life interaction tricky, so streaming is perfect for me. Plus, it funds my robot double project.  Hopefully, one day it can attend BlizzCon for me!",4.069023847579956
"I like to spend my weekends participating in live-action roleplaying events.  It's a great way to unwind after a long week of driving my Ford Pinto and listening to Insane Clown Posse.
